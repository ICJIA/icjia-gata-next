> The Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) of 2014, 30 ILCS 708/1 et seq., increased accountability and transparency in the use of grant funds and reduced the administrative burden on state agencies and grantees through adoption of federal grant guidelines and regulations.

> Pursuant to the Act, the Grant Accountability and Transparency Unit (GATU) was established within the Governor's Office of Management and Budget; GATU is charged with implementation of the Act in coordination with state grant-making agencies and nonprofit organizations in Illinois. GATA requires grants administered by state agencies to be awarded in a competitive bidding process. In addition, all applicants must undergo a registration and pre-award screening process. This competitive grant award process is initiated with a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).
